1.You are given an array of strings "arr". Your task is to construct a string from the words in "arr", starting with the 0th character from each word
(in the order they appear in "arr" ), followed by the 1st character, then the 2nd character, etc. If one of the words doesn't have an i'th character, skip that word.

Return the resulting string.
